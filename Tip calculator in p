#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.💪

#Write your code below this line 👇
bill = float(input("Enter your bill"))
tip = int(input("tip percent add"))
member =  int(input("in how many divided"))

billwithtip = tip / 100 * bill + bill
print(round(billwithtip / member ,2))
